# Operator Panel core

This package is repository-agnostic. It owns only HTTP serving, static assets,
exclusive subprocess supervision, progress presentation, guarded terminal input,
create-only configuration storage, and adapter-defined structured registration
forms. It has no Galaxea, ROS, camera, model, or tracked-config imports.

A consuming repository implements `PanelAdapter` to provide its catalog,
strict configuration validators, and argv-only workflow launches. Child
processes call `operator_panel.protocol.announce_input()` immediately before an
interactive prompt; the panel will accept one input and lock the buttons until
the next announcement. Long-running work may call `announce_progress()` with a
stable id, label, current value, optional total, phase, and concise detail. The
supervisor keeps only the latest value for each id, so progress refreshes do not
pollute the durable terminal history. These events are presentation-only and
cannot grant input or launch work.

Consumers implement the `PanelAdapter` methods and pass the adapter to
`serve_operator_panel(adapter, bind=..., port=...)`. Workflow forms,
select options, cameras, configuration kinds, and registration forms come from
the adapter's JSON catalog. The core only routes JSON values back to the adapter
and blocks registration while a workflow owns the panel; it does not know what
a registered record means. Camera presentation stays read-only: the adapter
supplies normalized freshness, frame-age, preview-rate, and error status without
giving the panel direct access to a device.

The terminal has its own bounded scroll area. It follows appended output only
while the viewer is already at the bottom, preserving their position while they
inspect older lines. Ordinary `[RUN]` status lines are similarly transient; the
latest one is shown above the terminal. Colors follow the browser's light or
dark preference.
